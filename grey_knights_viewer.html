    "description": "The Grey Knights are a secret and mysterious Chapter of Space Marines specifically tasked with combating the dangerous Daemonic entities of the Warp and all those mortals who wield the corrupt power of the Chaos Gods. They were created by the Emperor with the aid of Malcador the Sigillite at the time of the Horus Heresy to serve as Humanity's greatest weapon against the threat posed by the existence of Chaos. They have the honour of being implanted with gene-seed engineered directly from the genome of the Emperor Himself.\n<br/><br/>\nUnlike other Astartes, every Grey Knight is a potent psyker. Yet, in the 10,000 standard years of Imperial history, no Grey Knight has ever been corrupted by the Ruinous Powers of Chaos. Additionally, the Grey Knights do not follow the tenets of the Codex Astartes in the matter of force organisation.<br/><br/>\nConverted from KT21 Compendium by GuitarNinja",
