  <h1>Space Hulk Veterans - Kill Team Overview (Homebrew)</h1>
<h2>Description</h2><div>Terminators are Space Marine Veterans who have earned the right to wear Tactical Dreadnought Armour, better known as Terminator Armour. They are their Chapter's greatest infantry assets, each essentially serving as a walking tank.
<br/><br/>
Tactical Dreadnought Armour combines the technological developments of power armour with the sealed environmental suits designed for starship crews that work in highly unstable or corrosive environments such as inside the high pressure casings of Plasma Reactor shields. It can even withstand the colossal impact of high speed orbital micro debris.
<br/><br/>
Homebrew team by CT-7331, updated by Guitarninja.</div>

<tr><td class='w20'>Portable Barricade <span class='emphasis'>[Ability]</span></td><td class='w80'>A portable barricade is Light, Protective and Portable terrain.
Before the battle, you can set it up wholly within your territory, on the killzone floor and more than 2" from other equipment terrain features, access points, and Accessible terrain.
<br/>
<strong>Protective:</strong> While an operative is in cover from this terrain feature, improve its Save stat by 1 (to a maximum of 2+).<br/>
<strong>Portable:</strong> This terrain feature only provides cover while an operative is connected to it and if the shield is intervening (ignore its feet).
Operatives connected to the inside of it can perform the following unique action during the battle:<br/>
<strong>Move With Barricade (1 AP):</strong>
The same as the Reposition action, except the active operative can move no more than its Move stat minus 2" and cannot climb, drop, jump, or use any killteam's rules that remove it and set it back up again (e.gh. HEARTHKYN SALVAGER Fly, MANDRAKE Shadow Passage).<br/>
Before this operative moves, remove the portable barricade it is connected to. After it moves, set up the portable barricade so it is connected again, but the portable barricade cannot be set up within 2" of
other equipment terrain features, access points or Accessible terrain. If this is not possible, the portable barricade is not set up again.<br/>
This action is treated as a Reposition action. An operative cannot perform this action while within control range of an enemy operative, or in the same activation in which it performed the Fall Back or Charge action.</td></tr>

<strong>SMOKE GRENADE (1 AP):</strong><br/>
<ul>
<li>Place one of your Smoke Grenade markers within 6" of this operative. It must be visible to this operative,
or on Vantage terrain of a terrain feature that is visible to this operative. The marker creates an area of smoke 1" horizontally and unlimited height vertically from (but not below) it.</li>
<li>While an operative is wholly within an area of smoke, it is obscured to operatives more than 2" from it, and vice versa.
In addition, whenever an operative is shooting an enemy operative wholly within an area of smoke, ignore the Piercing weapon rule unless they are within 2" of each other.</li>
<li>In the Ready step of the next Strategy phase, roll one D3. Remove that Smoke Grenade marker after a number of activations equal to that D3 have been completed
or at the end of the turning point (whichever comes first).</li>
