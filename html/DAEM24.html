  <h1>Chaos Daemons - Kill Team Overview (Homebrew)</h1>
<h2>Description</h2><div>A Chaos Daemon, or simply Daemon, also known as a "Neverborn" amongst the forces of Chaos, is an intelligent and usually malevolent entity of the Warp comprised of purely psychic energy. Daemons are sentient embodiments of Chaos and collectively the greatest servants of the Chaos Gods and of Chaos itself as a universal force. 
 <br/><br/>
 Daemons are created at the whim of one of the four major Chaos Gods from a fraction of the god's own power within the Immaterium and act as an extension of its will. A Daemon's appearance and intrinsic character reflect the god's own nature. These Daemons may be reabsorbed into the god's psychic signature in the Warp at their whim.</div>
<h2>Operatives</h2><div>A CHAOS DAEMON KillTeam is composed of:
 <ul>
 	<li>
 1 CHAOS DAEMON operative selected from the following list:
 <ul><li>KHORNE BLOODREAPER</li><li>TZEENTCH IRIDESCENT</li><li>SLAANESH ALLURESS</li><li>NURGLE PLAGUERIDDEN</li></ul>
 	</li>
 	<li>
 9 CHAOS DAEMON operatives selected from the following list:
 <ul><li>KHORNE BLOODLETTER</li><li>TZEENTCH PINK HORROR</li><li>SLAANESH DAEMONETTE</li><li>NURGLE PLAGUEBEARER</li></ul>
 	</li>
 </ul>Other than FIGHTER operatives, your kill team can only include each operative on this list once.</div>
<h2>Faction Rules</h2>

</ul>
<h2>Powers of Khorne</h2><strong>Flaming Strike</strong><br/>
Use this POWER OF CHAOS when a friendly KHORNE DAEMON operative is fighting, the first time you strike with a critical success during that sequence. Until the end of that sequence, that operative’s melee weapon has the Shock weapon rule.<br/><br/><strong>Berzerker Rage</strong><br/>
Use this POWER OF CHAOS during a friendly KHORNE DAEMON operative’s activation, after it’s performed the Charge action and incapacitated an enemy operative during the Fight action, and is no longer within control range of
enemy operatives. That friendly operative can immediately perform a free Charge action using any remaining move distance it had from that first Charge action. That operative can perform two Charge actions during its activation to do so. The operative cannot have performed any other actions
during this activation (but can do so after resolving this POWER OF CHAOS).
<br/><br/><strong>Killing Blow</strong><br/>
Use this POWER OF CHAOS when a friendly KHORNE DAEMON operative is fighting or retaliating and you strike with a normal or critical success. Inflict d3 additional damage with that strike.<br/><br/><strong>Call to Slaughter</strong><br/>Use this POWER OF CHAOS during a friendly KHORNE DAEMON operative’s activation, when it incapacitates an enemy operative within its control range. Select one other ready friendly CHAOS DAEMON operative that’s visible to and within 3" of the incapacitated enemy operative. When that first friendly operative is expended, you can activate that other friendly operative before your opponent activates. When that other operative is expended, your opponent then activates as normal.<br/><br/><strong>Whirling Death</strong><br/>Use this POWER OF CHAOS when a friendly KHORNE DAEMON operative is incapacitated, roll 1D3. Inflict damage equal to the result on one enemy operative visible to and within 2" of that friendly operative.</td></tr>
