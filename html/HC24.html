  <h1>Hunter Cadre - Kill Team Overview (Homebrew)</h1>
<h2>Description</h2><div>A Hunter Cadre is the Tau terminology used to indicate what the Imperium of Man would call a company of soldiers. The Tau were once a species of hunters and gatherers and the Tau who now make up what is the T'au Empire's Fire Caste were the most-skilled hunters of that ancient time.
<br/><br/>
Even though the Tau are now a xenos species gifted in some areas with technology that is more advanced than that available to Mankind, the Tau Lexicon still makes use of much terminology derived from their hunter-gatherer period and companies of Tau warriors are always referred to as Hunter Cadres in the Low Gothic translation.<br/><br/>
Converted from KT21 Compendium by GuitarNinja</div>
<h2>Operatives</h2><div>A HUNTER CADRE KillTeam is composed of:
<ul>
    <li>1 HUNTER CADRE operative selected from the following list:
		<ul>
        <li>STEALTH BATTLESUIT SHAS'VRE* (counts as two selections) with fists and one of the following options:<br/>
            Fusion blaster (max one per killteam) or burst cannon</li>
        <li>FIRE WARRIOR SHAS'UI equipped with a gun butt and one of the following options:<br/>
            Pulse blaster, pulse carbine or pulse rifle</li>
        <li>CADRE FIREBLADE</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
    <li>11 HUNTER CADRE operatives selected from the following list:
		<ul>
        <li>FIRE WARRIOR SHAS'LA with Gun Butt and one of the following options:<br/>
            Pulse blaster, pulse carbine or pulse rifle</li>
        <li>STEALTH BATTLESUIT SHAS'UI* (counts as two selections) with fists and one of the following options:<br/>
            Fusion blaster (max one per killteam) or burst cannon</li>
        <li>MV1 GUN DRONE</li>
        <li>MV4 SHIELD DRONE</li>
        <li>MV7 MARKER DRONE</li>
        <li>MV36 GUARDIAN DRONE</li>
        <li>DS8 TACTICAL SUPPORT TURRET equipped with a missile pod or smart missile system</li>
        </ul>
	</li>
</ul>

Other than FIRE WARRIOR and STEALTH BATTLESUIT operatives, your kill team can only include each operative on this list once.<br/>
*You cannot select more than 3 of these operatives combined.
<br/><br/>
Some HUNTER CADRE rules refer to a ‘pulse weapon’. The following weapons are pulse weapons: burst cannon, pulse carbine, pulse blaster, twin pulse carbine.</div>
<h2>Faction Rules</h2>
<table>
<tr><th class='w10'>Title</th><th class='w90'>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td class='w10'>Bonded</td><td class='w90'>Whenever a friendly HUNTER CADRE operative (excluding DRONE) is shooting or retaliating with a ranged weapon (see Point-Blank Fusillade firefight ploy), if it’s within 3&quot; of another friendly HUNTER CADRE operative (excluding DRONE), that first friendly operative’s ranged weapons have the Accurate 1 weapon rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='w10'>Battlefield Leadership</td><td class='w90'>Once per turning point, you may use a Firefight Ploy for 0CP if the specified friendly HUNTER CADRE operative is visible to this operative.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='w10'>Camouflage Field</td><td class='w90'>Each time an enemy operative makes a shooting attack , unless it is within 2&quot; of this operative or it is a subsequent attack made as a result of the Blast special rule, this operative is always treated as being in Cover for that shooting attack. While this operative has a Conceal order, it is always treated as having a Conceal order, regardless of any other rules (e.g. Vantage Point).</td></tr>
<tr><td class='w10'>Art Of War</td><td class='w90'>Once per battle STRATEGIC GAMBIT. Select one of the following and apply its rules until the end of the turning point:
<ul>
    <li>Mont’ka: Add 1" to the Move stat of friendly HUNTER CADRE operatives.</li>
    <li>Kauyon: Each time a shooting attack is made against a friendly HUNTER CADRE operative, before rolling your defence dice, if it is in Cover, one additional dice can be retained as a successful normal save as a result of Cover.</li>
</ul>
</td></tr>
<tr><td class='w10'>Support Turret</td><td class='w90'>This operative may carry your DS8 Tactical Support Turret operative. It can perform the Pick Up Marker action on that operative, but that operative cannot be placed within an enemy operative&#x27;s control range (if this operative is incapacitated while carrying that marker, it is removed with this operative and counts as destroyed).</td></tr>
<tr><td class='w10'>Group Activation</td><td class='w90'>Whenever this operative is expended, you must then activate one other ready friendly FIRE WARRIOR SHAS&#x27;LA operative (if able) before your opponent activates. When that other operative is expended, your opponent then activates as normal (in other words, you cannot activate more than two operatives in succession with this rule).</td></tr>
<tr><td class='w10'>Artificial Intelligence</td><td class='w90'>
<ul>
    <li>This operative cannot perform mission actions or the Pick Up action</li>
    <li>For the purposes of determining control of objective markers, treat this operative's APL as 1 lower.</li>
    <li>Each time a shooting attack is made against this operative, in the Roll Defence Dice step of that shooting attack, if it has an Engage order, defence dice cannot be automatically retained as a result of Cover.</li>
    <li>When drawing a Visibility line from a DRONE operative, draw it from any part of the round disc at the top of the miniature, as shown by the red keyline area on the diagram below.</li>
    <li>Unless otherwise specified, this operative cannot be equipped with equipment.</li>
</ul>
</td></tr>
<tr><td class='w10'>Deployed</td><td class='w90'>You may choose not to set up this operative during the set up operatives step. Instead, it can be carried by your Fire Warrior Shas&#x27;Ui and may be placed via the PLACE MARKER action.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='w10'>Drone</td><td class='w90'>
<ul>
    <li>This operative cannot perform any actions other than Charge, Dash, Fall Back, Fight, Markerlight, Reposition and Shoot. It cannot use any weapons that aren’t on its datacard.</li>
    <li>Whenever determining control of an objective marker, treat this operative’s APL stat as 1 lower.</li>
    <li>Whenever determining what’s visible to this operative, the round disc at the top of the miniature is its head.</li>
</ul>
</td></tr>
<tr><td class='w10'>Markerlight</td><td class='w90'>Once during each of their activations, whenever an enemy operative that has any of your Markerlight tokens performs the Dash, Charge, Fall Back or Reposition action, remove one of its Markerlight tokens.<br/>
While only some HUNTER CADRE operatives can perform the Markerlight action, all HUNTER CADRE operatives can benefit from its effects. Whenever a friendly HUNTER CADRE operative is shooting with a weapon from its datacard (excluding ASSAULT GRENADIER’S fusion grenade), it has additional rules determined by the number of your Markerlight tokens the target has. These are cumulative, so if an enemy operative has two of your Markerlight tokens, the friendly operative shooting it has the rules for 1 and 2 tokens during that sequence.
<table class="eqtable">

<tr><td class='w10'>Shield Generator</td><td class='w90'>
<ul>
    <li>This operative ignores the Piercing weapon rule.</li>
    <li>Once per turning point, when an attack dice inflicts Normal Dmg on this operative, you can ignore that inflicted damage.</li>
    <li>You can use the Saviour Protocols firefight ploy for 0CP if this is the specified DRONE operative.</li>
