    The Grey Knights are a secret and mysterious Chapter of Space Marines specifically tasked with combating
				the dangerous Daemonic entities of the Warp and all those mortals who wield the corrupt power of the
				Chaos Gods. They were created by the Emperor with the aid of Malcador the Sigillite at the time of the
				Horus Heresy to serve as Humanity's greatest weapon against the threat posed by the existence of Chaos.
				They have the honour of being implanted with gene-seed engineered directly from the genome of the
				Emperor Himself.Unlike other Astartes, every Grey Knight is a potent psyker. Yet, in the 10,000 standard years of
				Imperial history, no Grey Knight has ever been corrupted by the Ruinous Powers of Chaos. Additionally,
				the Grey Knights do not follow the tenets of the Codex Astartes in the matter of force
				organisation.Converted from KT21 Compendium by GuitarNinja

       <ul>
        <li>
         Place one of your Smoke Grenade markers within 6" of this operative. It must be visible

								creates an area of smoke 1" horizontally and unlimited height vertically from (but not
								below) it.

        <li>
         While an operative is wholly within an area of smoke, it is obscured to operatives more
								than 2" from it, and vice versa.
								In addition, whenever an operative is shooting an enemy operative wholly within an area
